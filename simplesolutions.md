## Prevention


```{admonition} Create a Security Architecture
:class: tip, dropdown

So follow these simple steps:
* Do a risk analyse.
* Develop a security architecture.
* Develop a thread analyse and improve your architecture.


```

## Protection


```{admonition} Implement simple measurements that really help!
:class: tip, dropdown

The most security protection measurements are very simple and extreme effective.

So just do:
* Develop awareness within your company and awareness trainings a continuous process! [awaressness link]](link to courses)
* Always implement virus protection on MS Windows based platforms.
* Always implement network segmentation.
* Always implement some simple firewall rules. 


```

## Detection

```{admonition} Implement simple measurements that really help!
:class: tip, dropdown

Implement some simple but good detection measurements to detect security breaches. Else:everything you do is useless.

So just do:
* Use audit logging on file systems. Simple is: Use the audit capabilities that are delivered on your operating system. E.g. the FreeBSD audit system for determining read,write,changes on systems is simple but very effective. So use implement this. [FreeBSD Audit Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/audit/ )
* Use the default detection system to log and audit all successful and unsuccessfully login attempts on your network.


```

## Respond

```{admonition} Implement some simple procedures to respond on security incidents.
:class: tip, dropdown

Do not reinvent the wheel. For every simple or complex security incident a good procedure is already invented. 

So just do:
* Use and reuse existing security incident procedures.

## Recover

```{admonition} Make sure you have a recovery plan.
:class: tip, dropdown

Do not reinvent the wheel. A good recovery plan is simple: 
* Make backups and test recovery procedures.

Automate making the backups. But make sure that recovery is always manually verified.
Test for for disasters. So never ever assume that your backups can not be compromised or stolen.
