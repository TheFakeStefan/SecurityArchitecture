# Security Testing Manuals


Creating software is hard. Testing security risks even harder. So make
use of good open testing guides.

## OWASP Application Security Verification Standard

The standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing
technical application security controls, including architectural
concerns, secure development lifecycle, threat modelling, agile security
including continuous integration / deploynent, serverless, and
configuration concerns. See the latest version on the git repository:
<https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/v4.0.1> Or download the PDF from the
project main page:

## OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for
mobile app security development, testing and reverse engineering. See:
