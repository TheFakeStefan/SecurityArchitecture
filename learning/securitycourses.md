# Security Courses

The best courses to learn how to simplify cyber security
are open. So open access. Open access (OA) refers to freely available, digital, online information.

We prefer open access security courses that use a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/).

Instead of creating yet another cyber security training or course, why not making an existing training resources better?
