# Security classifications

Simple security classifications are the best.

A security classification specifies how people must protect the information and equipment they handle.

The classifications for material that should be protected because of security are:

* RESTRICTED
* CONFIDENTIAL
* SECRET
* TOP SECRET.


The classifications for material that should be protected because of personal privacy are:

* IN CONFIDENCE or
* SENSITIVE.

## Unclassified information

Information that doesn’t need a security classification is called ‘unclassified’ information. Most information fits in this category.

UNCLASSIFIED isn’t a real security classification, but it is used as a protective marking because it shows that the impact from unauthorised disclosure or misuse has been assessed.

Every large organisation must have a policy on how you will mark, protect, and handle information that needs increased protection but doesn’t qualify for a security classification.
