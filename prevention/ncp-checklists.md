The National Checklist Program (NCP), defined by the NIST SP 800-70, is the U.S. government repository of publicly available security checklists (or benchmarks) that provide detailed low level guidance on setting the security configuration of operating systems and applications.


Use the NCP Checklist to get a fast and good result on security configuration of operating systems and applications.
