# Simple QA Checklists

The landscape of cyber security solutions is filled with:
* Holy Grails and
* Failures

We are all humans. So for severe problems like mitigating cyber security risks we fall in love with so called 'Holy Grail' products. The product capabilities of these product are outlined with vague and difficult marketing buzz. So perfect for managers who lack a solid technical background.  Of course you have to trust the vendor since these too-good-to-be-true products are never F/OSS products. This of course to hide the fact that magic solutions do not exist. And security by obscurity is a bad security principle.

Failed security products are doomed when deployed. These products are characterized by:
* a complex setup
* propriety solution and
* complex mandatory maintenance and update processes.  
Too often these product introduces extra risks instead of mitigating risks. Deploying these products can be compared with deliberately installing a large backdoor in your trusted environment.

## Simple checklist 

Simple is hard. Especially to manage and mitigate cyber security risks. The context of cyber security problems consist of a mix of:
* People
* Complicated hardware and software
* Continues changes on all aspects involved
* Organizations 
* Internal and external threads
Putting a complex cyber security product in such a context is asking for failures. Stupid simple procedures and trainings for awareness are often as good or better than complex and expensive cyber security products to mitigate risks. 


A good cyber simple solution:
* does not reinvent the wheel.  
* is open source. 
* quality can be inspected
* follow the principles of reproducible build
* meets one or more open security standards that you can verify

A simple Cyber security product has:
1. Zero manual configuration challenges
2. Zero manual maintenance
3. Minimal dependencies and
4. Is created to do one thing, and only one thing, good!

A good simple cyber security products works without unnecessary additions and modifications in your perimeter. 

```{attention} 
**"The central enemy of reliability is complexity."**
```


Simplicity is the primary cyber security principle. All other principles must be sacrificed in favor of design simplicity.
