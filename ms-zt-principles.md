# Zero Trust principles (Microsoft)


## Verify explicitly

Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.


## Use least privileged access

Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive polices, and data protection to help secure both data and productivity.


## Assume breach

Minimize blast radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and app awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end to end. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.
