This reference architecture contains open reusable information to empower you to solve or mitigate security or privacy risks. This reference architecture is created to ease the process to create security and privacy solutions. It is time to stop reinventing the wheel when it comes down to creating security and privacy solutions. Build your specific solution on proven solutions. Making use of existing solutions is a far better investment in time and quality. 

The reference architecture is not just another security book. Since libraries and book stores are filled with decent books on security and privacy this book is all about using and reusing existing security and privacy solutions to simplify the process to solve your urgent use case.
